# [DBFZ Randomizer](https://dobosken.github.io/dbfz_randomizer/)

Don't feel like tryharding now that DBFZ has devolved into a party game?

Embrace degeneracy and generate a random team to go ungabunga with!

This is basically just a quick 'n dirty solution to the game's lack of random character select in online matches.

**Protip:** Screenshot the output and send it to a friend. Mirror matching random teams is pretty fun.
