Bandai forgot to ship the game with this function so here it is
thanks to the [dbfz randomizer](https://dobosken.github.io/dbfz_randomizer/) for idea and code

This is basically just a quick 'n dirty solution to the game's lack of random character select in online matches.

**Protip:** Screenshot the output and send it to a friend. Mirror matching random teams is pretty fun.
