# [DBSZ Randomizer](https://Harriotskelli.github.io/dbsz_randomizer/)

Bandai forgot to ship the game with this function so here it is
thanks to the [dbfz randomizer](https://dobosken.github.io/dbfz_randomizer/) for idea and code

Added some addtional QOL stuff let me know if if missed any Gokus or Vegetas or if you have an idea for addtional options

This is basically just a quick 'n dirty solution to the game's lack of random character select in online matches.

**Protip:** Screenshot the output and send it to a friend. Mirror matching random teams is pretty fun.
